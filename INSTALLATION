To run LTGen, we first need an environment, consisting of client machines, and server machines for HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, and FTP. In our experiments, we use OpenStack to create a virtual environment, with he topology as in ltgen_environment.png. This environment can be created in a automatic manner, by using HEAT module provided by OpenStack. An input YAML file, specifying this topology for HEAT, has been created in folder `heat_template`. To understand more about HEAT, please visit official websites of OpenStack.
